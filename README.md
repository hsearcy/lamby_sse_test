# lamby_sse_test
A super simple Raills/Lamby app to test Server Sent Events

## To run:

- `rails db:create`
- `rails tailwindcss:build` (not sure if necessary, but I ran it first)
- `rails s`

Then:
- Go to localhost:3000
- Click "Start Test"
- Numbers should stream in
- When done, Start Test should appear again
